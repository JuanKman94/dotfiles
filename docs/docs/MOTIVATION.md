## Surfing the urge

[The Willpower Instinct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg)

Train your willpower physiology: meditating, sleeping, exercising, eating a
diet that _sustains you_.

* Forgive yourself the next time you have a willpower setback
* Make friends with your future self: think about the future in a way that
feels real
* Predict your failure: get interest in the process of **how** you fail
* Surf the urge when facing temptation:
  1. Notice the thought, craving of feeling
  2. Accept and attend to the inner experience
  3. Breathe and give your brain and body a chance to pause an plan
  4. Broaden your attention, and look for the action that will help
  you achieve your goal
